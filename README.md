Hi everyone, here is Aurora. This is my personal website.

From my personal point of view, science should be accessible to everyone, even to people that have very little math knowledge.
For this reason, my idea for creating this sort of "blog" would be to simplify concepts found in papers and in scientific articles to make them understandable to everyone.

In recent years I have seen an increasing gap and rancor between the "professors" who studied science and people not in the field: the former accused the latter that science was not democratic, and therefore not accessible to all. The latter accused the former of speaking on purpose in order not to be understood.
I am a fervent supporter, perhaps idealistic, of both democracy and science. For this reason, I believe that finding a meeting point between the two positions is currently a pressing need.

Certainly, I'm not the best scientist nor analyzer in the world. I'm just a recent-graduated student in ICT.
But, despite this, I will put all my efforts into this outreach activity, because I think it's only fair that everyone is allowed to be able to understand how certain things work.

So, thanks a lot for passing, have fun!

P.s. You may ask why I'm using a GitHub page and not a site like WordPress or Wix.
The reason is pretty simple: I wanted to learn how to deal with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so I've tried to combine business with pleasure!
